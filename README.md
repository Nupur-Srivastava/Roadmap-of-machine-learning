# Step by step roadmap for machine learning 

Below is the step by step process of how you can start with zero knowledge and learn skills required to become machine learning engineer. Note that this will setup a solid base for you

### Computer Science Principals

Program or code runs on a computer and uses CPU,RAM, input/output devices. This khan academy course goes over all these basic principals of computer science. Data is stored as bits (1s and 0s) in RAM and disk. The course will also go over fundamentals of binary numbers. **In this course only follow first 4 sections (1) Digital Information (2) The Internet (3) Programming (4) Algorithms** Completing remaining sections is optional and do it if you have time and interest.

At this stage you are ready to write your first program and explore coding tutorials. The idea is to get basic understanding
of programming such as variables, data types, file operation etc.
 
### Level 1 Coding Tutorials
For python, I've have a tutorial for absolute beginners.

### Data Structures & Algorithms

There is not a single programming interview where they don't ask about data structures and algorithms (a.k.a DSA). DSA are
fundamental building blocks of any program (doesn't matter which programming language). Follow this playlist 
to get your data structure and algo concepts clear.
